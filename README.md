# CopyFileAplication

In this repository I have created a program that copies data from a file to another file.<br>
<b>"CopyFileThread"</b> class will copy the data.<br> <b>"CopyFileExecutorService"</b> class will perform the same task, but only using ExecutorService.<br>
<b>"CopyFileTest"</b> class starts the copying process and waits for a command from the user:
- "i" - interrupts the copying process;
- "p" - display the file copying process in percentage;
- "q" - exit the management console;
